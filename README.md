## Hello!

I am a game developer who has made several games with Unity and I'm working on my own C# game engine. I'm also learning C/C++ and CMake.

My favorite video game console is the Wii and I'm a big fan of Wii Sports and its sequel (Resort). I even started to develop a game inspired by Wii Sports. It can't be too similar to the original though, otherwise, Nintendo will get mad...

I constantly want to expand my knowledge and learn new things about programming, it really is my passion.
